# PowerGrid Bug Report


Thank you for reporting a bug and helping us to improve PowerGrid!

## Guidelines

`   üêõ `   We use GitHub Issues exclusively for tracking bugs and unexpected software behavior. 

`   üôè `  Please use the [Discussions](https://github.com/Power-Components/livewire-powergrid/discussions) tab for questions like _"How to...",_ "_how can I..."_ .

`   ‚úçÔ∏è `  Give this report a short but meaningful title. Make it easy to spot for others who might be facing the same issue.

`   ‚ö†Ô∏è `  Issues that do not describe a bug or do not follow the template will be closed.
